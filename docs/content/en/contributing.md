## Report bugs using [Github's issues](https://github.com/flewjs/flewjs/issues/new/choose)

Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/flewjs/flewjs/issues/new/choose). it's that easy!

Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code. [This is a great example](http://stackoverflow.com/q/12488905/180626) of a bug report. Here's [another example from Craig Hockenberry](http://www.openradar.me/11905408).

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can. [Like this stackoverflow question](http://stackoverflow.com/q/12488905/180626) includes sample code that _anyone_ can reproduce
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens. Possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work

People _love_ thorough bug reports.
