The **Reative Platform** is a set of tools which allows you communicate externally using a single, chainable and well designed API so you can build your apps really fast with a lot of fun.

Its concept is fully based on _Reactive_ _Programming_ meaning you're going to fully work using [Observables](https://rxjs-dev.firebaseapp.com/operator-decision-tree).

Our goal is to write once and deploy anywhere whether using TypeScript, Vanilla.js or Node.js. However in the browser it has a lot of cool features such as cache and state management. So that's a big win.
