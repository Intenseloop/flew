# flew

Fetch and data management reimagined

## development

- `git clone github.com/flewjs/flewjs`
- `cd flewjs`
- `npm install`
- `npx lerna bootstrap --hoist`

> now you should be set to go, everytime you change a lib you need to run `npm run build` from inside the lib folder to get it changes reflected across the monorepo
