# 4.0

- .http(fn) method doesnt work inside the constructor of instances generated by @Collection decorator. instead add .http(fn) in every chaining call
- http is the default driver now since firebase/firestore/parse lives on their respective packages. pay attention to specify a global or local driver to the call.
- now all server calls should respond in the same format as browser unless you set .raw(true)
- the global timestamp option has been changed. replace `timestamp: false` to `disableTimestamp: true`
